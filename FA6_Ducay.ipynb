    "The findings from the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests indicate that the assumptions for normality and equal variances are met for the Invisibility Cloak dataset. This suggests that it is appropriate to proceed with an independent samples t-test to investigate significant differences in the 'Mischief' scores between the two groups defined by the 'Cloak' variable. The tests' results support the reliability of proceeding with further statistical analyses to understand the impact of the Invisibility Cloak on 'Mischief' scores."
